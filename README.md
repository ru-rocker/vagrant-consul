Vagrant file for consul cluster


I made this as a reference for consul setup consul cluster. See (here|http://www.andyfrench.info/2015/08/setting-up-consul-cluster-for-testing.html).

# The vagrant consists of 4 virtual machine:
* consul1 for bootstrap and server
* consul2 for server node
* consul3 for server node
* consulclient for UI
